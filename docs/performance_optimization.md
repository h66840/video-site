# Performance Optimization Plan

## Current Performance Issues

1. **Memory Usage**: High memory consumption during video processing
2. **Collection Operations**: Slow operations on large datasets
3. **Data Structure Efficiency**: Suboptimal choices for frequent operations

## Proposed Optimizations

### 1. Replace Standard Collections
- Consider using specialized collections for better performance
- Evaluate primitive collections to reduce boxing overhead
- Implement custom data structures where appropriate

### 2. Memory Optimization
- Reduce object allocation in hot paths
- Implement object pooling for frequently used objects
- Optimize garbage collection patterns

### 3. Algorithm Improvements
- Use more efficient algorithms for common operations
- Implement caching strategies
- Optimize data access patterns

## Next Steps

1. Profile current performance bottlenecks
2. Research and evaluate alternative libraries
3. Implement proof-of-concept optimizations
4. Measure performance improvements
